        <p>Hello, my sweet baby! <br> I'm writing this in the brink of dawn, I can't sleep and I've been wanting to make changes with your site too hehe. It has been soooooooooo longgg, I've missed writing to you. I can't exactly tell what sets it apart, you know, considering we talk everyday hmmm. Maybe it leaves room for my unsaid thoughts, makes space for how I yearn and miss you when you're already in deep slumber. I love you so much, darling. I always dream of being with you instead of tending to my phone and exchanging messages. I admit it sorts of leave a hollow void inside me, no matter how much I mask it with weird, cute, funny memes, and sweet talks with you, I still miss you like crazy and it drives me insane how this distance is like a lightyear long. Won't be like this forever my baby :((. I'm grateful for how patient you've been all these time, thinking about it brings tears to my eyes and is making my throat sting. I'm sorry darling, I don't hold it against you for making the assumption that it's easy for me, I know you just miss me too, and that we both wish we're not apart like this. All this waiting is worthwhile for me, my baby, if it means I'll get to be with you, that's all that ever matters. The future's bright, I trust I'll be with you, and that it'll always be us, and I hope you won't let go of my hands until we get to do so.  <br> I love you, always and forever.</p>

        <p>Love, <br><strong>Co</strong></p>
