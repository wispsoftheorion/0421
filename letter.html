      <div class="letter-body">
        <p>Happy 19th birthday, remii! <br>I can't believe it. Time does fly by like fleeting wind, and suddenly, we're in college now, slowly taking baby steps towards our dreams. A lot has happened since, but no matter what, you're still my baby. 
        
        I love you so muchie, darls. I hope you'll like this at the very least hehe. This isn't much, but I poured my heart and soul (and brain) into this.<br> I love creating things for you, because you deserve everything and more, and that also, I want you to know that you're always worth the trouble. <br>
I know time hasn't been very kind to us, and I missed you dearly. You've consumed my waking days despite the deafening distance between us. And I hope you know, even with everything that’s happened, I still carry you in places I don’t show the world. You’re in everything I know, the songs I can’t skip, the dreams I refuse to throw away, ours rather. You’re in the parts of me that grow no matter what we go through.

If time must take everything, and though it will, I hope it leaves us with the memory and traces of having and being loved so truly that even time itself cannot bind us. You'll always have me. <br> I love you, always and forever.</p>

        <p>Love, <br><strong>Co</strong></p>
